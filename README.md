Stock Price Analysis and Beta Estimation (Excel Project)
This project provides a comprehensive financial analysis of selected stocks using Microsoft Excel, focused on evaluating risk and return characteristics through statistical modeling and market comparison. It is tailored for showcasing applied finance and investment skills to potential employers or academic institutions.

ðŸ§  Project Objectives
The main goal is to understand stock behavior, volatility, and systematic risk by performing the following key analyses:

Daily Return Calculation
Using historical closing prices, the project calculates daily logarithmic returns for individual stocks and the benchmark market index (e.g., S&P 500 or Nifty 50). This is crucial to normalize and understand the stock's daily performance changes over time.

Beta Estimation via Regression
The project estimates the Beta coefficient of each stock through linear regression analysis.

Beta measures a stock's volatility relative to the overall market.

A regression is performed using the formula:
Stock Return = Î± + Î² Ã— Market Return + Îµ

The slope of the regression line (Î²) indicates how sensitive the stock is to market movements:

Î² > 1: More volatile than the market

Î² < 1: Less volatile

Î² < 0: Inversely related to market

Volatility Analysis and Comparison
The project includes detailed computation of standard deviation (Ïƒ) for each stock's returns to quantify total risk (volatility).

It compares individual stock volatility against the market benchmark.

Helps distinguish unsystematic vs. systematic risk components.

Visualizations
To enhance understanding and presentation:

Line charts of daily closing prices

Scatter plots of returns with regression line for beta estimation

Histograms of return distributions

Volatility comparison bar charts
These visuals support storytelling and insight-driven decision-making.

ðŸ”§ Tools Used
Microsoft Excel
All analysis, regressions, charts, and return computations were conducted using built-in Excel functions and formulas (e.g., =SLOPE(), =STDEV.P(), =LN(), etc.)

No external tools or programming were required, making it ideal for Excel-savvy finance analysts.
